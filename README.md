# Brastewark

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.0-rc.1.

## Info
The gender is calculated using "gender-detection" library and if the given result is "unknown" then I assume arbitrarily then pink and green hair gnomes are female.

I asserted than the json source is always available online... It is easily possible to develop a fallback using the last stored version.

## Try it

```
node --version
# v14.21.3
npm i
npm run start
# Navigate to http://localhost:4200/
```
